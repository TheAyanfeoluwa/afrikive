                        John Allan Masese was born in 1944 amongst the rich shades of green and yellow that made up the
                        grandiose plantations of Kericho. The aroma of long-lost tales traveled in and out of the
                        valleys, burnt and hidden under layers of distortion. Masese's father worked within the endless
                        fields of tea, the boy, little and lithe, often listened with frightful ears to the events
                        unfolding just over the valleys. They would whisper 'The Mau Mau have moved on to... and have
                        captured...'. He listened with fear, imagining and mentally preparing for the possibility of his
                        family's demise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even worse was the looming anxiety of the European defense forces wreaking havoc, shooting
                        randomly or raiding the people. They justified this under their so-called 'moral obligation' to
                        restore peace by any means necessary. To regain "their" colony, "their" Kenya. John lived with a
                        constant dread that one day, he too might become a victim of an event similar to the Lari
                        massacre.

                        As the dew hung heavy on the budding grass, John rose with the sun. Alongside the other shadows
                        in the morning mist, John would go off to school. Off to a dimly lit classroom to read off a
                        blackboard and learn of situations a lifetime away from his own. His classrooms overflowed with
                        both young Black boys and brilliance. Yet, forced into learning only of selective history that
                        frequently excluded them unless when discussing their people's subordination. In the breaks the
                        boys huddled, convening to share the stories they had heard the night before. Fright shrouded
                        with a sort of humor.

                        'They say so and so is hiding a pistol underneath his hair,' they giggled, laughing at the
                        absurdity whilst internally longing for more information. Apropos of this amusing niter-natter
                        was an officer who used to ride a motorcycle around the province, his hair growing like a
                        healthy tree, round and trimmed. He could well have a pistol hidden within those branches. The
                        officer was taken to the detention center soon after under suspicion of being a Freedom fighter.

                        As the seasons turned and the jacaranda trees bloomed, turning the wind a vibrant shade of
                        purple, John's primary school was coming to an end. Amongst 30 others in a cramped room, he was
                        handed an exam paper. The Common Entrance exam for the Africans. The whites were allowed to take
                        the KCPE Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education. They didn't have to worry about the next stage
                        in the same way he did. The way the 30 others did. They all knew the chances of making it to the
                        next stage were slim as they spitefully scratched at the paper with a feeling of inferiority
                        devouring their minds. The process of sieving had begun. 15 passed. Only 3 including John were
                        able to go to secondary school.

                        High school was a different experience. The law now forced European schools to take all races.
                        Of course, treatment was not the same, and much like other aspects of society, privilege was 'a
                        gradient-white, Asian, then Black'. However, change was on the horizon and all Kenyans were
                        beginning to see a future of choices. Choices for them, by them. Looking to the future, there
                        was only one university - The University of East Africa in Dar Es Salaam. Opportunities for
                        higher education were scarce in East Africa. There were constituent colleges spread out across
                        the region like Makerere in Uganda but all in all 'there were very limited institutions for
                        African learning'.

                        Amid this landscape, on one pivotal day, incoming president Jomo Kenyatta was released. Word
                        spread in a matter of minutes that he would be passing through the Kisiitown Kisumu Highway a
                        somewhat close distance to John's school in Nyaparoro. The air throughout the school fizzled
                        with anticipation. Students daring to request allowance to witness the momentous event were met
                        with a red-faced headmaster. 'No, you can't, that's not a good person to go and see. He doesn't
                        even believe in God!'. To the white Headmaster, this was the genesis of a recession, just as it
                        was a progression to the Black people. Regardless the students rioted and ran to observe the
                        passing car, cheering with a new sense of honor and dignity within their souls.

                    <p>
                        As a result of their disobedience, they were met with manual labor punishment. The next week
                        they became slaves, their education revoked, and their bodies put to work. Despite everything,
                        Masese was content. The sense of satisfaction gained surpassed consequences. He witnessed a
                        turning point in Kenya's history. Slowly changes began to shape the nation. Prince of Whales
                        School became Kenya High School; hospitals began to accept patients based on need rather than
                        race. 'Land-less' Kenyans moved from the small, overcrowded "native reserves," which had been
                        'graciously' allotted to them on the White man's thousand-acre estate, under a 999-year lease
                        from the distant British monarchy. Then, in 1963, the rise of internal self-government began to
                        shift the balance of legal and social power, offering Africans better opportunities and making
                        liberties an entitlement instead of a privilege.

                    <p>
                        Post Kenya's achievement of independence (1962), John attended the newly established Kenyan
                        School of Law. It was founded under the collaborative agitation of the Kenyan government and a
                        group of local lawyers. As John entered the legal field, remises of the struggle for equality
                        remained evident. There was a huge gap in the profession with roughly 99% of lawyers being white
                        and non-African. Simply put, there was much to be done that could not be achieved in a fleeting
                        instant. Despite the achievement of freedom from Britain's grasp, there were more people to be
                        trained and more institutions to be founded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a nutshell, independence brought numerous opportunities to local people socially,
                        economically, and politically. The political shift fostered a never-before-seen environment
                        where human rights became accessible to all races. While Kenya's constitution no longer supports
                        discrimination, the ongoing battle in certain parts of the republic persists, with tradition and
                        statute remaining at loggerheads. Masese provides the example of a young widow left with only a
                        daughter to inherit her late husband's land. Dissatisfied with this option she adopted 4 boys;
                        however, they greeted her with foul treatment. The lady decided to give her daughter a piece of
                        the land, leaving the rest to the boys. The community was in uproar, chasing the girl away
                        despite a court order allowing her to own the land. Steeped up in tradition they went against
                        the government itself.
                    </p>

                        Only by reconciling the past can Kenya fully realize its purpose within progress and unity. As
                        John puts it, "Kenya is the best in the world". But to truly be the best, progress must be
                        relentless, and the courage to evolve must never waver. The fight must continue, and the
                        openness must stay consistent. For John, experiencing independence meant a myriad of
                        opportunities unfolding before him . The struggle has shaped who he is today, allowing him to
                        practice and teach law as a Kenyan citizen . However, it is essential to recognize that
                        implementation of the progressive reforms remains challenging .
